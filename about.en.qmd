Hello!

I am a [Posit/RStudio certified tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/milz+beatriz/), a data scientist at [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/), and a teacher at [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/), at [cebrap.lab](https://cebrap.org.br/cebrap-lab/) and the [IME/USP Summer Program](https://www.ime.usp.br/verao/index.php/turmas/apresentacao.php).

I started writing about R in 2019. I am active in the R community in Brazil, participating in the co-organization of communities and events, such as: [R-Ladies S達o Paulo](https://rladies-sp.org), [Latin-R](https://latin-r.com/), and [satRday S達o Paulo](https://saopaulo2019.satrdays.org/).

I am a PhD Candidate at the [University of S達o Paulo](http://www.iee.usp.br/), in Environmental Sciences.

My research is about **information transparency** in the **management of water resources** used for public supply in the S達o Paulo Macrometropolis.
